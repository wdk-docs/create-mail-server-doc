Elastic Compute Cloud
============================
Impressions
Easy to use. Anyone can use, not just big companies. Very useful. Tools are command line but simple. Firefox extensions work well. Recommended.
I find it very usefull. Basically it is a colo hosting environment. Some may use it as for Saas, ie single scalable application in the cloud, but I use it as a hosting environment for complete servers.
ec2 introduction, tips and howtos
I have made a separate tips and howto on the use of ec2 for general server needs. Hope it will be useful for people.
How I use it for my mail servers
Different images to launch for different needs. Good way to scale backup MXs if needed. Can script backup to S3 of mail dirs etc.
Using EC2 with this howto
If you plan to use EC2 to follow this howto, then familiarise yourself with EC2 first. Check the links further down, e.g. my tips.
Once competent enough on EC2, launch the latest official Ubuntu ec2 image or one of Eric Hammond images. You can cheat by using my other images, but you should really know how the whole server was built by starting from the bottom.
When using EC2 images, be aware of security groups as they restricts access to your server on top of the firewall. Initially you will need SSH (22) access, quite soon you will need SMTP and IMAP ports opened, 25,143,465,587 and 993, and eventually webserver ports of 80 and 443. Read here for tips on securing AMIs.
Also do not terminate your instances without backing up your machine. This you can do by either create your own image. Or backup certain data if you got an image to instantiate from. Back up to S3 or your local machine. Create images only now and then. Backup configurations, database, maildirs more regularily.
Once launched, follow my Initialize section.
1st note: Spamhaus.org lists amazons ec2 ip ranges as dynamic, thus many mail servers will reject emails from it. (Including other people using this howto.) But Spamhaus has a simple web page to remove ips, which they link to in rejection messages. Simple look in your logs, click on the link on follow the instrucions: basically fill in your ip, email and state its for a mail server. Then Spamhaus will remove your IP from their database.
2nd Note: Amazon has extended this spam limitations, so if you have a busy mail server, follow their FAQ entry for removing mail throttling.
3rd Note: This fix needs to applied to the instances buildt on an early 8.04 base. This is not a problem with the later Hammond or any Canonical based images.
4th Note: Check I have not left my SSH key in the root or ubuntu user.
5th Note: Please let me know if I've been silly enough to leave a bash history or anything like that?
