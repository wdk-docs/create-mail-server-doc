管理
==================

启用Web访问
------------------

You may need to enable web access in the firewall. Check the firewall configuration if this neccessary.

安装 phpmyadmin
--------------------

.. block-code:: sh

   sudo aptitude install phpmyadmin
   
Enter Yes to set it up, enter root mysql password, enter a phpmyadmin mysql user password twice. Accept apache2 as the web server.

You may choose to restrict phpMyAdmin to a spefic virtual host. If so you need to, edit

.. block-code:: sh

   sudo vi /etc/apache2/conf.d/phpmyadmin.conf
   
and comment out the alias.

.. block-code:: apache

   #Alias /phpmyadmin /usr/share/phpmyadmin
   
And insert the alias instead into a virtual host configuration in /etc/apache2/sites-available/. For this example we are not, and for testing we keep the Alias uncommented.

Reload apache to activate changes. First test if ok.

.. block-code:: sh

   sudo apache2ctl -t
   
Then reload it.

.. block-code:: sh

   sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 reload
   
You can now go to http://yourdomain.com/phpmyadmin/, and login with the mail user. You can use it as it is, but I recommend securing it a bit more.

One simple way is adding apache's .htaccess login requirement.

Further restrictions can be restricting to a specific virtual host. Or renaming the folder. Purely ubfuscating, but simple.

Or using the example in the webmail section, and adding SSL requirement to the connection. Or disabel mysql root's access via phpMyAdmin.

Please refer to previous edition for example on htaccess, and mysql user restriction.
