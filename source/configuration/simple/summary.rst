总结
========

You now have a basic mail server!

Before continuing to the advanced and secure mail server you must ensure the basic setup works. This will save you from loads of pain further on. 

It is very easy to make typos, miss tiny steps, unclear steps or simple actual errors in this howto.

Insert stub data from data section

Apply advice from test section judicously

Ensure the mail server can receive email correctly first, then try sending.

Once you are positive the mail has been received, the mail folders have been automatically created,

only then you should test if you can actually read the emails before proceding

Ive created an EC2 bundle for this stage: flurdy-amis/ubuntu-mail-server-simple.
